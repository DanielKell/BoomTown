# Boomtown

The goal of this project is to create a web-based application to support a local sharing economy. Functionally, the app allows users to browse all items and see which have been borrowed by other users. It also has access to user profiles, where the users can see how many items they've borrowed/lent, and which items are theirs.

The project uses local mock data, React and the Material UI library to build out the application's UI, Redux and react-redux to manage application state, and React Router for routing.
